## Inspiration 💡
ClarityHub was born out of a need for a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for buying and selling products and services. ClarityHub offers buyers and sellers a direct communication channel via chat, creating a more efficient, trustworthy, and easy-to-use marketplace.

## What it does 🚀
ClarityHub is a decentralized marketplace that enables users to buy and sell products and services using cryptocurrencies or tokens. The platform is built on top of a blockchain network to ensure transparency and security of transactions. It also features an integrated chat functionality that allows buyers and sellers to communicate with each other directly, creating a more transparent and efficient buying process.

### Features 🔥
- User Registration and Authentication 🔑: Users can create an account on ClarityHub and authenticate themselves using their private key. Users can directly use their wallets to log in.

- Product and Service Listings 📦: Users can create listings for their products and services. Listings will include product/service descriptions, prices, and pictures. Users can manage their listings, update prices, and delete listings as per their requirements.

- Transactions and Payments 💰: Users can buy and sell products and services using STXs and tokens. It uses smart contracts to ensure that transactions are executed securely and transparently.

- Chat Functionality 💬: ClarityHub has an integrated chat functionality that allows buyers and sellers to communicate with each other directly. This helps buyers in clarifying their doubts and negotiate the price.

- Wallet Integration 💳: This integrates with users' wallets to facilitate payments and transactions. Users can manage their wallet balances, view their transaction history, and withdraw their funds.

## How we built it 🔨
ClarityHub is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain network. The front end is built using React, and the back end is built using Node.js. We used Clarity to write smart contracts that handle transactions and payments. It is hosted on IPFS, which provides a decentralized storage solution. We integrated Hiro to facilitate wallet integration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We are proud of creating a secure and transparent platform for buying and selling products and services. We are also proud of integrating the chat functionality, which provides a more efficient and transparent buying process.

## What's next for ClarityHub 🚀
In the future, we plan to add more features to ClarityHub, such as auctions, escrow services, and dispute resolution mechanisms. We also plan to expand the platform to support more cryptocurrencies and tokens. Our ultimate goal is to create a decentralized and transparent e-commerce ecosystem that benefits both buyers and sellers.

Hope you enjoyed the project 😃
